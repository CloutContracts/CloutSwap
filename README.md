# CloutSwap
This is an open-source fork of the [Birbswap Interface](https://github.com/birbtoken/birbswap-interface), but for [CloutContracts](https://cloutcontracts.net). This is an alternative frontend for Uniswap and not independent or its own DEX. Any actions you decide to do are at your own risk. This isn't meant to be looked at as an exchange of financial instrument. This is an open-source frontend and experimental technological tool and to be looked at as such.
